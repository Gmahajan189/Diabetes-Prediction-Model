# Diabetes-Prediction-Model

Developed a machine learning model to predict diabetes using datasets with features like glucose levels, age, BMI, and more.
Algorithms Used: Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM

Pipeline:

Data Preprocessing: Missing data imputation, feature scaling
Class Imbalance Handling: Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class, improving model performance
Model Training: Trained models using Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized model performance through grid search and random search for hyperparameter tuning
Model Evaluation: Evaluated performance using AUC-ROC, precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy
