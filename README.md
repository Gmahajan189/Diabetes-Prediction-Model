# Diabetes-Prediction-Model

Developed a machine learning model to predict diabetes using datasets with features like glucose levels, age, BMI, and more.
Algorithms Used: Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM
Class Imbalance Handling: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is applied to generate synthetic samples for the minority class to improve model performance.
Pipeline:
Data Preprocessing:
Missing data imputation
Feature scaling
